      There's a stigma surrounding marijuana use that it makes you lazy. However, not all strains of cannabis turn you into a complete couch potato.

Research has supported a link between the brain's CB-1 and CB-2 cannabinoid receptors and dopamine. Essentially, small doses of marijuana won't hurt your efficiency level, and an increase in dopamine levels gives you the focus you need to get your shit done.

If you're looking for a little pick-me-up, swap out your coffee and smoke a Sativa-dominant strain like Sour Diesel or Jack Herer, instead.
